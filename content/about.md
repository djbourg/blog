I am Assistant Professor and started in August 2020. Before restarting my career in academia I worked for 5 years in the Oil and Gas Industry. My research interest are in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and welding engineering. I am a NDE technology enthusiast, consume different types of media, and write about how they may apply to my research to increase my understanding. I hope you find these posts to be valuable.

Thank you for your time!
