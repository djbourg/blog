      <description>Ultrasonic technology is causing a shift in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and testing (NDT) industry. Many companies are moving toward ultrasonic testing (UT) as an alternative to radiographic testing (RT). UT uses ultrasonic waves to perform weld inspection, while RT uses x-rays to perform weld inspection. In my career, I have used more RT than UT for oil and gas weld inspection. This is not to say that RT is better than UT, but there are more UT solutions finding their way into the NDE market.</description>

      <description>I taught a lecture on radiation source in my introduction to nondestructive evaluation (NDE) course in late March 2022. During the lecture I thought to myself, “What if you could use a black hole as your x-ray source?” I know that this idea is far from being possible with today’s current technology and may be a bit controversial. But, I wonder how the NDE industry (particularly radiography) would change if using black holes was feasible.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this blog is to take the first steps on my quest to make engineering more accessible. I am fully aware that I will not change the landscape of engineering over night let alone by myself but, I have studied engineering for the past 18 years and what I have found and experienced is that if a scholar of engineering is not careful they can make themselves become obsolete due to the ever changing landscape of the engineering field and the evolution of the general public.</description>
